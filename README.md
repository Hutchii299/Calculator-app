# Calculator-app
Frontend Mentor challenge Calculator App. I completed this challenge using Sass and javascript MVC pattern. The design has three seperate themes to choose from. I also capped the numbers allowed to be entered into the screen by the actual screen width, this way numbers did not overflow the screen.
